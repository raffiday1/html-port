<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>My name is Raffi Day, i am a web developer with a passion for creativity. I started my life as a footballer, played from the age
  of 3 years old, this journey included many ups and downs, i have signed for many clubs and also been released by many: Bolton
  (signed at 6 released by 10), i then had to decide wether it was something i wanted to pursue or if i wanted to go back to being a 
  normal kid who trains 5-6 times a week, i decided i wanted to further pursure it which forced me to kn uckle down and get better
  at my craft, this taught me from a young age how to use adversity and failure to achieve greater things than previously intended.
  This then lead to me signing a contract at huddersfield town, sadly, they shut their academy system down about a year after i had left,
  however, due to the work i had put in other clubs had taken notice, not even a week after huddersfields closure i had signed at burnley,
  this is where issues started to come along with injuries, i played about 3-4 years here before being released again. This was like a knife 
  to the gut, but again, i had a devcisioon to make and i decided to double down and work even harder, i ended up signing at rochdale 
  before finally moving lower to halifax town to gain first team experience, this decision payed off briefly as i made my first team debut 
  at 17 years old, all the failures and adverity turned into hard work had payed off in that moment, this was sadly quite short lived 
  as i ended up tearing my ACL, Meniscus and MCL the nexy day.

  This started a new phase of my life, a time like no other that required the strongest of faith that all would work out, i did manage to
  return to football for a few months after a grueling 9 months of physio post surgery, yet again, the adversity want finisehd with me,
  i dislocated my other knee which then also required surgery, this operation was successful however the rehab was not as smooth as expected.
  What seemed at the time as a 3-4 month recovery time turned into a 14 month process due to some delayed healing. This forced me to retire 
  from the game i had dedicated my life to leaving me stranded. However, Jesus Christ saved my life, have gave me many paths to choose from
  and it was up to me wether i wanted to keep working hard or settle for a 9-5 and a regular life. After some time of despair i decided it 
  was time to get my head down and work again, trust the Lords plan for my life and continue moving forward. I am currently a proffesional
  Forex trader and web developer and am looking to continue diverisfying my skills portfolio with the intentions of building a secure,
  happy life for me and my family
</p>

<p>But mainly, i am a follower of Christ, like i previously mentioned he saved my life, and in return i strive to live the way he taught
  me to live, Glory be to Him always and peace to all who read this, in His name.
